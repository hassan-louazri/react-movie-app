# HOW TO USE
You need two things: API_KEY and BASE_URL

To get them, create an account with TMDB: themoviedb.org and get your own API_KEY, it's free for personal use.

Then, create a file called ".env.local" at the source of your project and add the two variables as follows:

VITE_API_KEY="{your api key here}"
VITE_BASE_URL="{your base url here}"

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Launch
npm run dev

ENJOY!
